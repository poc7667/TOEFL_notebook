# Sample 

In my view, passion is the most important characteristic in a teacher for two important reasons.
First, a teacher’s passion motivates students.
For example, when I was in High School, our teachers were really motivated. And, that motivated us.
Second, a teacher’s passion motivates the teacher.
For example, in university, I had a passionate chemistry teacher. He loved chemistry so much that he taught really well.
That’s why passion is the most important characteristic.
